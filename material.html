<p>Cyber Security is about identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting them, and defending against them. This encompasses all aspects of systems: software, hardware, physical security, and human factors. We will explore a range of topics through examples of vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.</p>

<p>Although not strictly prerequisites for this module, you should be familiar with basic aspects of computer security (e.g. CS140) and low-level programming (e.g. CS132). </p>

<h3>Confidentiality & Use of Encryption</h3>

<p>Materials for Cyber Security must not be shared outside of the Department of Computer Science. Furthermore, all materials are encrypted and the corresponding decryption key must be obtained for each resource. To decrypt a resource, you may use the following shell script where <code>FILENAME</code> is the name of the encrypted file, <code>PASSWORD</code> is the password, and <code>OUTPUT</code> is the name that should be given to the decrypted file:</p>

<pre>
$ openssl enc -in FILENAME -d -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:PASSWORD -md md5 > OUTPUT
</pre>

<p>Access to confidential files is restricted by different security levels. Hints to the different access codes are linked to below.</p>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Access Level</th>
            <th>Hint</th>

<h3>Slack</h3>

<p>There is a Slack team for this module. You can sign up for it with your <code>@warwick.ac.uk</code> email address at <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/dcs-cs263/signup">https://join.slack.com/t/dcs-cs263/signup</a>. You can use this to ask questions about the coursework or Cyber Security more generally. You can also ask us questions during lectures via Slack if you prefer that approach over shouting your question at me! For all this, you can choose to remain anonymous as well as we do not require you to sign up with your name.</p>

<h3>Security Briefings</h3>

<p>There are 20 security briefings in Term 1. During Term 1, the briefings will take place on Thursdays at 1800 hours in L5 and on Fridays at 1500 hours in S0.21. The first briefing is on 3 October 2019.</p>

<h3>Cyber Warfare Simulations &amp; Training</h3>

<p>Training sessions take place on Wednesdays at 11am, Thursdays at 1pm, and Fridays at 11am and 12pm. There are no sessions in Week 1 and the first is on the Wednesday in Week 2. You are free to join any two groups through Tabula, but try to keep numbers evenly balanced.</p>

<p>In addition to the above Cyber Warfare Simulations, there are plenty of extra Cyber Security exercises available on the internet, which are linked to below. There are also frequent CTF events run by various companies and organisations which take place throughout the year and I will try to advertise those to you when possible.</p>
